# lib/

Add any function here that is needed in more than one parts of your
application, or that you otherwise wish to extract from the main function
scripts.

Note that code here should be wrapped inside bash functions, and it is
recommended to have a separate file for each function.

Subdirectories will also be scanned for `*.sh`, so you have no reason not
to organize your code neatly.
