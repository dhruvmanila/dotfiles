_Magical objects that make certain computers extremely usa-able for me._

## Installation

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dhruvmanila/dotfiles/master/bin/dot setup)"
```

The installation script is auto-generated using
[bashly](https://github.com/DannyBen/bashly) whose source code resides in the
`src/` directory. Currently, this is only compatible on a mac machine, but
should work mostly on Linux as well.

***I would not recommend running the above script without fully understanding
what it actually does.***
