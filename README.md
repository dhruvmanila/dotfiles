# dotfiles

Download the dot script and run it in bash:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dhruvmanila/dotfiles/master/bin/dot)"
```

**WARNING:** The above script is not fully upto date and do not run it without taking a look at what it actually does. I am probably going to be moving away to another way of managing the dotfiles. Some of my options: Ansible, dotbot, etc.
