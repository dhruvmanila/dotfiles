# Mackup configuration file

# You can specify the storage type Mackup will use to store your configuration files.
# For now you have 4 options: dropbox, google_drive, icloud, copy and file_system.
#
# If none is specified, Mackup will try to use the default: dropbox. With the dropbox
# storage engine, Mackup will automatically figure out your Dropbox folder.
[storage]
engine = icloud

# If you want to specify another directory, you can use the "file_system"
# engine and Mackup won't try to detect any path for you: it will store your
# files where you explicitly told him to, using the "path" setting.
# The "path" can be absolute (from the / of your drive) or relative to your
# home directory.
# The "path" setting is mandatory when using the "file_system" engine.
# Note: you don't need to escape spaces or wrap the path in quotes.
#
# [storage]
# engine = file_system
# path = some/folder/in/your/home
# # or
# path = /some/folder/in/your/root
# # or
# path = /some path/in/your/root

# You can customize the directory name in which Mackup stores your file. By
# default, if not specified, Mackup creates a "Mackup" directory in the storage
# engine you chose, e.g. "~/Dropbox/Mackup".
directory = backup

# List of applications you want to explicitly sync.
# One application name per line.
# If this list is empty, Mackup will try to sync all the supported
# applications.
#
# To see a list of supported application names, launch mackup list
#
# [applications_to_sync]
# irssi
# ventrilo
# xemacs

# List of applications you want to ignore.
# One application name per line.
# If an application is ignored, it will be ignored even if it's been explicitly
# allowed in the [Allowed Applications].
#
# To see a list of supported application names, launch mackup list
