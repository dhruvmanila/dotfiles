# This script is mainly to act as a wrapper for `nnn`. The tool only has support
# for `trash-cli` which provides a `trash-put` command which the explorer uses.
#
# To enable:
#
#     `export NNN_TRASH=1`

trash -F "$@"
#      │
#      └ Ask Finder to move the files/folders to the trash.
#        This ensures that Finder plays the "trash" sound, and
#        that the "put back" feature is enabled.
