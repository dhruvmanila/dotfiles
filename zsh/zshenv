# Do not modify this file unless you know exactly what you are doing. It is
# strongly recommended to keep all shell customization and configuration
# (including exported environment variables such as PATH) in ~/.zshrc or in
# files sourced from ~/.zshrc.

# Don't source any global config files from `/etc`.
#
# We only want *our* config files (zshrc, zshenv, ...) to be sourced, because
# we want *total* control over our shell.
